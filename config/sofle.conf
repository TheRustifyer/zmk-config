# Eager Debouncing
# Eager debouncing means reporting a key change immediately and then ignoring further changes for the debounce time. This eliminates latency but it is not noise-resistant.
# ZMK does not currently support true eager debouncing, but you can get something very close by setting the time to detect a key press to zero and the time to detect a key release to a larger number. This will detect a key press immediately, then debounce the key release.

# Uncomment the line below to disable external power toggling by the underglow.
# By default toggling the underglow on and off also toggles external power
